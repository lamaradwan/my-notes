## About me
I'm Lama Radwan, I'm 26 years old, a person who has a passion for coming into a new adventure in life, I have graduated from JU with computer information systems major. worked as a technical support for about 10 months then I've started my **Software Quality Assurance** Career. and currently I'm steering my career path to the **software development** field.

## What I've learned from the  [Good Developer Mindset](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/) article?
Well, I actually learned a lot from reading this article.
Here are some of the lessons that stick in my head:
- The developer's thinking should be simple and clear.
- The written code should be maintainable and easy to read so the other new developers can understand and modify it properly.
- The time estimation of the tasks should be overestimated sometimes so that the developer takes his/her time implementing or fixing it.
- The code should be tested and the developer shouldn't fix a bug without seeing it, he/she can use the logs for that.
- The developer shouldn't assume anything additional in the system that is not required at a time or not necessary.
- Any task it it a new change or a bug fixing should be prioritize before starting working on it, there is a princible can help in this. it's as follows:
1. The **Desire** of the developer to make it
2. Evaluatee how the **Value** of this change can help
3. Estimate the needed **Effort** and the available capabilities

Here is a quote that I liked from the article:
> If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. — Richard Feynman

### There is a good book inside the article They recommend to read: It's *Code Simplicity* by *Max Kanat Alexandar*
